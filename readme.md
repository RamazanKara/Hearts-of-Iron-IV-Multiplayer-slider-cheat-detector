# Hearts of Iron IV Multiplayer Slider Buff defector

## Installation

Use hoi4_buffdetector.bat if you have not changed the directory of your paradox save games. It will output the savefiles, which have buff sliders on.

If you have changed the directories of your savegames, use the hoi4_buffdetector_withoutpaths.bat batch file and copy it to the folder where the savefiles are.
